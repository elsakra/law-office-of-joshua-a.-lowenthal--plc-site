Hiring an attorney can be a big decision. This is a professional who will help Shepard you  through the nuances of starting, running, or exiting your business. 

While there are plenty of free or reduced cost services available to you, a lawyer has the understanding and knowledge of handling tens, if not hundreds of similar situations. The value in hiring an experienced business attorney is not in filing forms, this much you can do on your own. Rather, a business lawyer has the experience to provide you advice in minutes that may take you days or weeks to arrive at. Our value comes from spending thousands of hours working through complex situations so that we can provide you solutions quickly and efficiently.
