Unlike many business attorneys, I bring a unique blend of tax and business background to every matter that I handle. With a background counseling mid-cap and global fortune 500 companies, my breadth of knowledge and experience in both business and US federal tax will help your business thrive. 

Moreover, as a solo attorney, I take my job very seriously. I understand the challenges of being a small business owner because I am one. For me, you are not just another client, rather I take the time to invest in each of my clients. I want to know who you are and why you love what you do. When you work with me, you won't just talk to my staff, but you will work with me directly.
