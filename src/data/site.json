After earning my law degree, I launched my legal career at a regional public accounting firm focusing on middle-market mergers & acquisitions and tax controversy. I also worked for a Big 4 public accounting firm before practicing in estate planning and probate litigation group of an international law firm headquartered in Metro Detroit. Growing up as the oldest of four siblings and the son of a single-parent, I understand just how busy life can get. For this reason, I created a web-based law firm to allow clients to easily communicate with me on their schedule, regardless of the hour. Also, because I don't have costly office space to maintain, I am able to keep my overhead low and provide my clients high-quality services at reasonable rates.",
